```DATA.m``` preprocess the data;

```MIL_FS_ADNI.m``` and ```MIL_VBM_ADNI.m``` learn the projection using VBM and FS respectively, 

```Performance_FS.m``` and ```CNN_FS_RAVLT.m``` learn a enriched representation compare the enriched  representation by using different methods -- LR, RR, Lasso, SVR and CNN using modality of FS;

```Performance_VBM.m``` and ```CNN_VBM_RAVLT.m``` learn a enriched representation compare the enriched  representation by using different methods -- LR, RR, Lasso, SVR and CNN using modality of VBM;
